# Matrix-Multiplication-with-c

this is a simple code which can find any matrix mutliplication


In first line of output of this code INPUT: you need to enter ther dimentions of matrixes a,b,c of matrixes axb,bxc
eg: 5 4 3
In Next Line of Output of this code INPUT: Matrix 1(5x4)
eg: 1 2 3 4
    2 3 4 5
    3 4 5 6
    4 5 6 7
    5 6 7 8
In Next Line of Output of this code INPUT: Matrix 2(4x3)
eg: 1 2 3
    2 3 4
    3 4 5
    4 5 6
Then  You get the resultant multiplied matrix
eg: 30 40 50
    40 54 68
    50 68 86
    60 82 104
    70 96 122
